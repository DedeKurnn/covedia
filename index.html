                        <h2>COVID-19 Antibodies Last for at Least Four Months After Recovery</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Study of COVID-19 patients in Iceland represents the largest effort yet to assess the body’s immunological...
                        <br><br><br> response to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Antibodies generated to combat infection peaked in the two months following a positive diagnosis before plateauing for a further two months in more than 90 percent of recovered
                        patients, the authors report. </p>
                    <<p>The findings, published September 1 in the New England Journal of Medicine, partially contradict previous reports of antibodies sharply declining following recovery. The authors witnessed that decline as well, but it was supplanted
                        by a secondary, more stable wave of antibodies. If these antibodies remain protective over time, that would have positive implications for vaccine development and immunity to reinfection.
                        </!>
                        <p>Two experts who weren’t involved in the study described the behavior of antibodies over time in an accompanying editorial. “The first wave [of antibodies] is generated by early short-lived plasma cells . . . but this wave subsides
                            rapidly after resolution of acute infection. The second wave is generated by a smaller number of longer-lived plasma cells that provide long-lived immunity,” the authors of the editorial report. “A rise and early decay of antibodies
                            was observed in the Icelandic study, but with limited loss of antibodies at later time points, a finding that points to stable SARS-CoV-2 immunity for at least 4 months after infection.”
                        </p>
                        <p>To arrive at this conclusion, the authors sampled more than 30,000 people—roughly 15 percent of Iceland’s population—beginning in the early days of the pandemic in February and continuing into early July. They split their cohort
                            into three groups: those who had a positive COVID-19 diagnosis confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), people who had been exposed to the virus but not necessarily infected, and those without any known exposure.</p>
                        <p>Each person was tested using six antibody assays, including two that targeted the entire suite of IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies rather than a single type. A person was counted as a positive case if those two “pan-Ig” assays came
                            back positive.
                        </p>
                        <p>Based on their findings, the authors estimate that roughly 1 percent of the population of Iceland has been infected with COVID-19 since February, with a fatality rate of 0.3 percent, roughly three times that of the seasonal flu,
                            the Associated Press reports.</p>
                        <p>The researchers used the subset of roughly 1,200 patients who had received a positive diagnosis by qPCR to track their antibodies over time. Within this group, 91 percent had antibody levels that rose during the first two months
                            after diagnosis before plateauing for the following two months.</p>
                        <p>The editorial cautions that populations or even individuals in other countries may not respond the same way to SARS-CoV-2 infection as in Iceland. Future studies will be needed with more diverse cohorts to see how well their results
                            hold up. “That said, this study provides hope that host immunity to this unpredictable and highly contagious virus may not be fleeting and may be similar to that elicited by most other viral infections,” the authors of the
                            editorial say.
                        </p>
                        <p>The study did not test whether these longer-lived antibodies are protective against reinfection. “What we don’t know is really the million-dollar question: How do these antibodies reflect immunity against this virus and inhibition
                            of this virus,” Jason Kindrachuk, a medical microbiologist at the University of Manitoba who wasn’t involved with the research, tells NBC News. “Just because you see antibodies being produced, it doesn’t tell you that those
                            antibodies are going to act specifically against the virus.” </p>

                        <h2>Papua New Guinea tackles the threat of COVID-19 with an all-of-government approach</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>In parts of the world where COVID-19 has not yet spread widely, governments have a critical opportunity to step up... <br><br><br> prevention and response capacities. Papua New Guinea (PNG) is taking the threat of the pandemic seriously
                        with an all-of-government approach in strengthening the country’s health system and engaging communities to keep them safe from the virus. </p>
                    <p>“We know that about 15% of COVID-19 cases will need some form of hospital care. If 10,000 people get sick – that’s about 1,500 people needing care. This can easily overwhelm our health system,” said Dr Gary Nou who leads the frontline
                        Government response for COVID-19 in the National Capital District.</p>
                    <p>WHO Representative to PNG, Dr Luo Dapeng, says the priority at present is to increase testing for early detection and quick response; strengthen health care delivery; and identify and protect vulnerable populations. WHO continues to
                        support the Government to prepare the health system for the worst-case scenario, as well as to build upon the country’s emergency response mechanism</p>
                    <p>From the start of the pandemic, WHO and the PNG Government have taken every opportunity to work more closely together to better respond to COVID-19 and improve the country’s emergency preparedness and response. This includes leveraging
                        the work already taking place under the UHC Partnership, which is funded by the European Union, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Irish Aid, the Government of Japan, the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, the UK Department
                        for International Development and Belgium.</p>
                    <p>Working with the Prime Minister, Treasury and Ministry of Finance to support a whole of government response to COVID-19, WHO helped to establish an inter-agency financing coordination mechanism around COVID-19 expenditure.</p>
                    <p> <span>Flexible funding</span> from the UHC Partnership is also enabling WHO to provide additional technical and strategic support that builds on its previous work to strengthen the health system. This includes primary health care,
                        mental health, surveillance and legal reform, which are helping the country respond to COVID-19, maintain essential health services during times of emergency and build a stronger system for the future.</p>

                        <h2>Science and Policy Collide During the Pandemic</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Science has taken center stage during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early on, as SARS-CoV-2 started spreading around the globe, many researchers pivoted... <br><br><br> to focus on studying the virus. At the same time, some scientists and
                        science advisors—experts responsible for providing scientific information to policymakers—gained celebrity status as they calmly and cautiously updated the public on the rapidly evolving situation and lent their expertise to help
                        governments make critical decisions, such as those relating to lockdowns and other transmission-slowing measures.</p>
                    <p>“Academia, in the case of COVID, has done an amazing job of trying to get as much information relevant to COVID gathered and distributed into the policymaking process as possible,” says Chris Tyler, the director of research and policy
                        in University College London’s Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP). </p>
                    <p>But the pace at which COVID-related science has been conducted and disseminated during the pandemic has also revealed the challenges associated with translating fast-accumulating evidence for an audience not well versed in the process
                        of science. As research findings are speedily posted to preprint servers, preliminary results have made headlines in major news outlets, sometimes without the appropriate dose of scrutiny.</p>
                    <p>Some politicians, such as Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, have been quick to jump on premature findings, publicly touting the benefits of treatments such as hydroxychloroquine with minimal or no supporting evidence. Others have
                        pointed to the flip-flopping of the current state of knowledge as a sign of scientists’ untrustworthiness or incompetence—as was seen, for example, in the backlash against Anthony Fauci, one of the US government’s top science advisors.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some comments from world leaders have been even more concerning. “For me, the most shocking thing I saw,” Tyler says, “was Donald Trump suggesting the injection of disinfectant as a way of treating COVID—that was an eye-popping, mind-boggling
                        moment.” </p>
                    <p>Still, Tyler notes that there are many countries in which the relationship between the scientific community and policymakers during the course of the pandemic has been “pretty impressive.” As an example, he points to Germany, where
                        the government has both enlisted and heeded the advice of scientists across a range of disciplines, including epidemiology, virology, economics, public health, and the humanities.</p>
                    <p>Researchers will likely be assessing the response to the pandemic for years to come. In the meantime, for scientists interested in getting involved in policymaking, there are lessons to be learned, as well some preliminary insights
                        from the pandemic that may help to improve interactions between scientists and policymakers and thereby pave the way to better evidence-based policy.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Sita Tyasutami had all the tell-tale symptoms of coronavirus. Yet, as she lay in a hospital bed in Indonesia's...<br><br><br> capital Jakarta, her condition had not been diagnosed. Nor had that of her mother, Maria Darmaningsih, who
                        had been admitted to the same hospital.</p>
                    <p>TConfined to separate hospital rooms, Tyasutami and her mother were anxiously awaiting the results of their coronavirus tests, when Indonesia's president made a startling announcement.</p>
                    <p>In a news conference broadcast to the nation, President Joko Widodo said two Indonesian nationals had tested positive for Covid-19, the first two confirmed cases in the country. The pair - a 64-year-old woman and her 31-year-old daughter
                        - were being treated at an infectious diseases hospital in Jakarta, the president said.</p>
                    <p>The briefing, held in front of jockeying reporters outside the presidential palace, confirmed the inevitable: coronavirus had reached Indonesia. Aired on TV screens at the hospital, the president's announcement left Tyasutami and her
                        mother in disbelief. President Widodo was talking about two patients at their hospital, with their profiles, their ages, their symptoms, their contact history.</p>
                    <p>President Widodo did not mention the patients by name, but he did not have to. Her brain whirring, Tyasutami asked a nurse whether the hospital was currently treating any other coronavirus patients. When the nurse said no, reality
                        hit her like a punch to the gut.</p>
                    <p>She and her mother had been revealed as the first two known cases of coronavirus in Indonesia. "I was confused, I was angry, I was sad," Tyasutami told the BBC. "I didn't know what to do because it was all over the media."</p>
                    <p>Before her diagnosis, Tyasutami was a professional dancer, a performing arts manager, a sister, a daughter, a friend. Afterwards, her identity was reduced to a humiliating two-word label: case one. Her medical records were leaked.
                        The details of her case were misreported. False rumours spread online. Within a matter of hours, she became the face of Indonesia's coronavirus outbreak.

                        <h2>Bali closed to foreign tourists until end of 2020</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>Authorities of the popular holiday destination had earlier said foreign visitors would be allowed to return from next month. But the plan has been... <br><br><br> scrapped over concerns about Indonesia's mounting Covid-19 cases. The
                        move has renewed worries about the impact on residents in an economy heavily dependent on tourism. Millions of foreigners fly to Bali each year in search of deserted beaches, terraced rice fields and sprawling Hindu temples.
                    </p>
                    <p> But their numbers have dropped sharply since Indonesia closed its borders to non-residents, like other countries battling with the pandemic. Since the end of July the island has turned to domestic visitors to help its ravaged tourism
                        industry, the heart of the local economy, reopening beaches, temples and other landmarks to local travellers. But hotels and restaurants have been struggling to survive, with many resort workers returning home to villages and small
                        towns to earn an income.</p>
                    <p>The statement did not specify when Bali would reopen to foreign travellers but said Indonesia would not be open to international tourists "until end of 2020". The governor said reopening would require "prudency" and careful preparation,
                        because failure could damage the island's recovery and reputation. Bali had reported 4,576 coronavirus infections and 52 deaths as of Monday. Nationwide, Indonesia has reported more than 155,000 coronavirus infections and at least
                        6,759 deaths - the highest number of fatalities in South East Asia. Experts believe the numbers would be higher if there was more testing.</p>

                        <h2>Asia's fishermen and farmers go digital during virus</h2>
                    </a>
                    <p>During a national lockdown, farmers from Malaysia's Cameron Highlands were faced with throwing away tons of fresh vegetables. Wet markets were... <br><br><br> shut down as social restrictions were introduced to stop the virus spreading.
                        E-commerce was their saviour as they went online for the first time to connect with customers. It has been a similar story for farmers and fishermen across South East Asia as they embrace a new way to sell. Malaysia's national
                        lockdown, which it calls a Movement Control Order (MCO), has been in place since March and was recently extended to 9 June.</p>
                    <p>Steve Teoh is the owner of the Deoness Plantation in Cameron Highlands, 200km north of Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, where he sells corn and flowers. "When the Movement Control Order happened, I was looking at probably throwing
                        away the harvested flowers since the demand abruptly stopped overnight as florist shops had to close," he said. Thankfully, Singapore-based e-commerce platform Lazada stepped in to bring Mr Teoh onboard and connected him with an
                        online florist to sell his flowers to a new customer base.</p>
                    <p>The company also helped other farmers facing the same problem in Malaysia, with piles of fresh fruit and vegetables they couldn't sell in the traditional way. In the first weekend of the lockdown, more than 1.5 tons of vegetables were
                        sold, according to Lazada.Audrey Goo is the owner of Malaysia-based MyFishman, a fresh seafood subscription and delivery service in Malaysia. She also faced the problem of not being to sell at wet markets or deliver fresh fish
                        before she joined the e-commerce platform</p>
                    <p>"Businesses in every industry and sector, including those in agriculture, are pivoting online to capture the new opportunities arising from changing consumer preferences," said Pierre Poignant, group chief executive at Lazada.In Indonesia,
                        farming cooperative Rumah Sayur Group has ventured online to help 2,500 farmers from 89 villages sell their fresh produce. The group previously sold direct to supermarkets, hotels, restaurants and cafés in the Greater Jakarta area.
                        But when the pandemic hit, sales dropped by more than 60%. That's when they turned to e-commerce. Indonesian farmer Pak Opik mostly sells "exotic" vegetables such as purple cabbages and Japanese cucumbers in traditional wet markets
                        in the Jakarta area and West Javan city of Bandung. "The current pandemic situation is very challenging for us farmers, as we are used to selling our products through the traditional channels," he said.</p>
